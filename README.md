# Running the VCX Java Demo

### Alice/Faber demo
The alice/faber demo is widely used in the indy-sdk demo. The description of the VCX node demo explains it well, 
including the operation of the cloud agent. 
[Description here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx/wrappers/node#run-demo).

### Pre-requirements
#### Libraries
Before you'll be able to run demo, you need to make sure you've compiled 
- [`libindy`](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/libindy)
- [`libvcx`](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx)
- [`libnullpay`](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/libnullpay)
- Optionally [`libindystrgpostgres`](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/experimental/plugins/postgres_storage) if you want to run demo
with postgres wallet.

Library binaries must be located `/usr/local/lib` on OSX, `/usr/lib` on Linux. 

#### Java wrapper for VCX library
**You can skip this step** because this code gets the pre-built LibVCX wrapper from skt-develop maven repository.

Or you can build and use the LibVCX wrapper. [Instructions here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/wrappers/java/README.md#jar).

See `dependencies` section in `build.gradle`.

#### Indy pool
**You can skip this step** because this code uses the skt testnet.

Or you can run pool of Indy nodes on your machine. You can achieve by simply running a docker container
which encapsulates multiple interconnected Indy nodes. 
[Instructions here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#how-to-start-local-nodes-pool-with-docker).

See `genesis_path` of `vcxConfig` variable.

#### Dummy Cloud Agent
**You can skip this step** because this code uses the skt test dummy cloud agent.

Or you can run dummy cloud agent on your machine. [Instructions here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx/dummy-cloud-agent).

See `agency_url` of `provisionConfig` variable.

### Steps to run demo
- Run Faber agent, representing an institution
```
./gradlew faber
```
- Give it a few seconds, then run Alice's agent which will connect with Faber's agent
```
./gradlew alice
```

### Demo with Posgres wallet
You can also run demo in mode where both Faber and Alice are using Postgres wallets. Follow 
[instructions](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/experimental/plugins/postgres_storage) to 
compile postgres wallet plugin and startup local postgres docker container. 

Once you have that ready, use these commands to start demo in postgres mode.
```
./gradlew faber_pg
```
```
./gradlew alice_pg
```

### Demo with webhook notifications
Another feature are webhook notifications. The above demo works based on polling, but when using webhook feature, 
it works based on notification.
```
./gradlew webhook_faber
```
```
./gradlew webhook_alice
```

Faber receives messages of dummy cloud agent at `localhost:7201/notifications`. Similarly, Alice receives 
at `localhost:7202/notifications`. The action is performed based on the message received, which is briefly 
described below.

| Phase | Faber | Alice |
|---|---|---|
| connection | STEP.1 - create connection F & send invitation | STEP.2 - receive invitation & create connection A2F |
|  | STEP.3 - update connection from F to F2A | STEP.4 - connection created |
|  | STEP.5 - receive connection created ACK |  |
| credential | STEP.6 - send credential offer | STEP.7 - accept credential offer & request credential |
|  | STEP.8 - send credential | STEP.9 - accept credential |
| proof | STEP.10 - request proof | STEP.11 - send proof |
|  | STEP.12 - receive & verify proof | STEP.13 - receive proof ACK |

When Alice starts, it automatically gets an invitation from Faber's `localhost:7201/invitations`. So, in a situation 
where Faber is running normally, run Alice.
